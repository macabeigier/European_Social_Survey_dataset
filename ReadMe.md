# European Social Survey (ESS) dataset

## Introduction

**Goal**
Generate visualizations to compare the levels of subjective well-being, social exclusion and religion in Germany (DE), Austria (AU), Switzerland (CH) and Spain (ES).

**Data**
The [ESS] (https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/ ) is an academically-driven multi-country survey, which has been administered in over 30 countries to date. Its three aims are:

 1. monitor and interpret changing public attitudes and values within Europe
 2. advance and consolidate improved methods of cross-national survey measurement in Europe
 3. develop a series of European social indicators, including attitudinal indicators

In the dataset chosen for this study we find cumulative data in the integrated ESS files in two or more rounds about people in Germany (DE), Austria (AU), Switzerland (CH) and Spain (ES) in the ESS round 8 (year 2016). 



**Features**

Subjective well-being; social exclusion; religion.



### Methods

The libraries used to generate the visualizations are `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn` and `plotly`.

Visualizations generated:

- features with missing values
- percentages of the population in each selected country that gave a certain answer to a survey question
- maps indicating percentages of people in each selected country that gave a certain answer to a survey question 



### Conclusions

- **CH** shows higher proportion of super happy people.
- **DE** has the higher proportion of unhappy people (but percentages are still very low so itâ€™s nothing to worry about).
- **ES** shows the higher proportion of people who meet every day with friends, relatives or work colleagues.
- **AT** has the higher proportion of people who belong to a religion.
